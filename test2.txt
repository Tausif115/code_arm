1.DC1 <speed>
Controls linear actuator / DC motor 1 (connected to BTS1)
Positive number (e.g. DC1 150): Moves forward at speed 150/255
Negative number (e.g. DC1 -80): Moves reverse at speed 80/255
2.DC1 0: Stops actuator 1 immediately (coasts)

3.DC2 <speed>
Same as above, but for linear actuator / DC motor 2 (BTS2)
4.DC3 <speed>
Same as above, but for linear actuator / DC motor 3 (BTS3)
5.S1 <steps>
Moves stepper motor 1 (DM860H on pins 12/13) by a relative number of steps
Positive = one direction
Negative = opposite direction
Example: S1 500 → 500 steps forward, S1 -1200 → 1200 steps backward

6.S2 <steps>
Moves stepper motor 2 (DM860H on pins 47/48) by a relative number of steps
(same behavior as S1)
7.POS1 <position>
Moves stepper motor 1 to an absolute position (in steps, counted from where it thinks position 0 is)
Examples:
POS1 0 → go back to software home / zero
POS1 3000 → go to step position 3000

8.GRIP <angle>
Sets the gripper servo to a specific angle
Range: 0 to 180 degrees
Examples:
GRIP 0 → usually fully closed
GRIP 90 → middle / neutral
GRIP 180 → usually fully open

9.STOP
Immediately stops all motors (all 3 DC actuators + both steppers)
10.ESTOP
Same as STOP (emergency stop alias)
